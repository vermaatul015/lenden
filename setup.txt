Steps to follow for full laravel zip:

1. Add database name and db connection in env file.
2. If image or file is there, 
	- Update 'APP_PATH' in env, if this project will be present inside public_html/sub_folder then APP_PATH=/sub_folder/public.
    	- execute  (php artisan storage:link) in terminal or run /storage-link in browser to create storage link for accessing saved files, 
		url: http://example.com/public/storage-link
3. Execute (php artisan migrate) in terminal to create all tables in the database
4. After adding all this, project will run in /public/route-group (if any)
	eg: considering project is uploaded in public_html, then project will run using "http://example.com/public/<route-group>" url
5. Now finally, to login to the project we need to add data to admin_users table, which can be done by one of the following way:-
	- Exceute (php artisan db:seed) which will add one user data to the table and now login can be done using credentials
      		email => admin@yopmail.com, password => 12345678 
    	- Or, register a new user using the following url: http://example.com/public/register
6. All the data are send from controller to views via "$data" array. Please update as per requirement.
